# Formspree Configuration
# =============================================================================
# This project uses Formspree to handle contact form submissions securely
# without needing a database or server-side code. Formspree provides a
# serverless backend that forwards form data to your email.
#
# WHY FORMSPREE?
# - No database required
# - Built-in spam protection
# - Email notifications for new submissions
# - Free tier: 50 submissions per month
# - GDPR compliant and secure
#
# SETUP STEPS:
# =============================================================================
#
# 1. CREATE A FORMSPREE ACCOUNT (FREE)
#    - Go to https://formspree.io
#    - Click "Sign Up" and create a free account
#    - Verify your email address when prompted
#
# 2. CREATE A NEW FORM
#    - In your Formspree dashboard, click "Create a new form"
#    - Give your form a descriptive name (e.g., "Kyros Contact Form")
#    - The form will be created and you'll see its unique ID in the URL
#
# 3. GET YOUR FORM ID
#    - After creating the form, look at the URL in your browser
#    - It will look like: https://formspree.io/forms/xrbaloye
#    - The form ID is the part after "/forms/" (e.g., "xrbaloye")
#    - You can also find it in your dashboard under the form's settings
#
# 4. CONFIGURE EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS
#    - In your form settings, go to the "Emails" tab
#    - Add your email address to receive notifications when forms are submitted
#    - You can add multiple email addresses if needed
#
# 5. SET UP ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
#    - Copy this file to create your .env file: cp .env.example .env
#    - Replace "your_form_id_here" below with your actual form ID
#    - Save the .env file
#
# REQUIRED: Your Formspree form ID (get this from step 3 above)
FORMSPREE_FORM_ID=your_form_id_here
#
# EXAMPLE:
# If your form URL is https://formspree.io/forms/xrbaloye
# Then set: FORMSPREE_FORM_ID=xrbaloye
#
# =============================================================================
# TESTING YOUR SETUP:
# - Run your development server
# - Submit a test form on your website
# - Check your email for the notification
# - Verify submissions appear in your Formspree dashboard
#
# TROUBLESHOOTING:
# - Make sure the form ID is copied exactly (case-sensitive)
# - Check that your .env file is in the project root
# - Restart your development server after changing .env
# - If you exceed 50 submissions/month, upgrade to a paid plan
